# This Works only on windows
 Dependency to be installed :  pynput

# ---how to install---

make sure you have the path to python in your windows environement and then type the following line in cmd

python -m pip install pynput

After the installation everything is gonna if you execute the program as admin (my advise is to turn it into an executable before, using pyinstaller)

# - Use of pyinstaller
install it from the command prompt using : pip install pyinstaller.
When it's done, go to the program directory and open the command prompt. then, type : pyinstaller -w -F filename.py

the executable will be genereted in the folder : /bdist

# How to use it

when you want to lock your keyboard and mouse input just open the program/executable as administrator and then press
 -press 'ctrl_l + alt_l + enter' to enable and desable the locker
 -since the app will be running in backgroung, in order to completely close it just press 'ctrl_l + alt_l + ctrl_r + alt_r'
